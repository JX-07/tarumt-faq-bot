      🏫 TAR UMT Official Policy on Discipline
      From the TAR UMT Student Dress Code:

      Students are expected to dress according to the guidelines (e.g., collared shirts, no torn jeans, proper footwear).
      Disciplinary actions will be taken against those who flout any dress or behavior rules—but no specific penalties (e.g., fines or warning thresholds) are provided in the publicly available code. 
      ⚠️This means the policy authorizes enforcement, but doesn’t list details such as warning limits or fine amounts.
      🔄 Insights from Other Institutions (For Reference)
      
      While TAR UMT doesn’t specify penalties by name, similar Malaysian universities often impose:
      💲A first offence: warning + fine up to ~RM50
      Repeated offences: disciplinary referral to a Student Disciplinary Committee 
      So it’s possible that TAR UMT applies a comparable framework, but this is not confirmed via official sources.

      Students are not allowed to enter specific facilities such as labs if they do not follow the dress code.

  utter_faq/smoking:
  - text: |
      🚭 Smoking & Vaping Policy
      According to TAR UMT’s Student Dress Code and regulations:
      The entire campus is designated a non‑smoking and non‑vaping zone. This applies to both traditional cigarettes and electronic smoking devices. 
      Smoking, vaping, or using any tobacco product anywhere on campus—including indoors, outdoors, dorms, and transit areas—is strictly prohibited. 
      Disciplinary measures may be taken if the rules are violated.

      Valid reasons may include:
      Hospitalization or medical condition (attach medical certificate)
      Bereavement (proof required)
      Accident or legal emergency

      - Resubmit all assignments
      - Re-sit tests and final exam
      - You will get a “Fail (Barred)” grade recorded for that subject.
